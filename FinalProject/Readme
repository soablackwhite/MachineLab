**Concept and description:

This project is a modified version of the pinball machine, where the goal is to survive for the longest time possible. 
Two of the attractions are electrical while the rest is mechanical. The player starts with launching the ball, then uses the mechanical 
paddles to keep the ball in game as long as possible while the timer is running. Once the ball falls between the paddles, it triggers the
button which shows the current score. The screen can also store the value of the highest score and display it.


* Elements:

Pinball box: 55cm x 100cm

Launcher:
  4x springs
  2x corks: one for the handle the other for pushing the ball
  
Pinball handles:
  4x Rubber bands
  2x Screw Hooks

Barbie rotating wood ramp:
  1x Stepper motor
  2x Barbie hands as barriers
  4x Rubber bands on top of the ramp to fire back

 Magnetic car:
  2x magnet: one attached to the car, the other attached to a piece of plywood
  1x DC motor to rotate

Push-back platform: 
  1x spring
  1x acrylic piece

* Challenges & Limitations:
- We couldn’t make the handles. The biggest problem with this was the precision it would require to dig holes of a certain size on either
side of the pinball box, which was aggravated by the fact that we didn’t have access to the necessary tools. Then, there would be the 
problem of finding dowels that actually fit the size we would go for. As we couldn’t find any, we had to try making our own, which was 
really hard as we didn’t have much practice with making
- We might have wanted to do more calculations, because the distance between the paddles was too big.
- We assumed lights were the easiest to implement so we left them last, which was a very bad decision because although the code and wiring
wasn't hard, figuring out the problems with neopixels isn't evident.
- Making the attraction to between the magnet and the car strong enough to be able to go back into place after getting hit by a pinball. 
We succeeded at first, but it seemed that the longer the car ran, the weaker the magnets grew, but we didn't know that was the case. When
we'd turn the power off and wait it a few minutes to test, it would work again. We still need to figure this out. 

* Process:
- We cut the wood for paddles then sanded them into the desired shape, most of the design was inspired from https://www.instructables.com/id/Pinball/
- Cutting wood to make the box, we chose a smooth surface for the ball to roll. Dimensions inspired from https://www.instructables.com/id/Pinball/
- We prepared the launcher, which took a lot of precision in making the hole, because we wanted the cork to slide again the surface and face resistance
in order not to wobble around. But we also wanted to minimize this resistance so that the friction doesn't slow down the launching mechanism. Lot of trial & error here
- Miscenalious attractions: we started making easy mechanical attractions to experiment.
- Our first time with electronics: we started wiring stuff and motors to make sure they work—though we didn't attach them to anything, 
but we played around with code and changed some of our initial ideas
- We wanted to include a loopty loop, really badly. It took us about 3 hours to make one sticking small pieces of cardboard together at
small angled intervals so as to create a circular ramp, but it didn't look aesthetically pleasing at all and after a bit of playing around
we discarded it.
- After the death of the loopty-loop, we couldn't figure out a mechanism that uses motors but would be sort of complicated. So we started
walking around the map, looking for inspiration. We played around with the magnets on the scissors, and at that moment we decided that we'd use
them for our project—that's how the magnetic car came to be.
- We put everything together with a switch-sensor
- We added the barbie ramp attached to the stepper motor, we added a metallic ramp at the very top, next to a counter-shot mechanism that 
sends your shot against you if you hit it.
- Set up the LCD, which was very hard to wire because of the confusing reversal of ports
- We chose to use 3 arduinos to reduce interactions between the music program, the lights, and the motors. However the lights ended up not working.
